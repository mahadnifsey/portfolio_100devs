                    <div><p>Iâ€™m a Front-End Developer seeking a challenging opportunity in a versatile industry. 
                        Motivated to progress my personal development in this field that I fell in love with after 
                        spending over 10 years as a mechanical design engineer. These two disciplines often
                        overlapped, which further heightened my curiosity. Over the past few years during the
                        pandemic and mandatory lockdowns, I started building my own projects as well as supporting
                        my friends with their own start-ups.
                        
                        As a mechanical design engineer, I have experience in various industries
                        from; Automotive, Industrial Agriculture, Oil and Gas, Renewable Energies and
                        Consumer Products. With these experiences, I had found various transferrable skills
                        that appeared complimentary for a career in web development.
                        I enjoy problem solving, building client relationships, managing projects and products, 
                        as well as research and development. I am excited for a career change and believe I am ready 
                        to apply my passion for coding to a exciting engineering team to develop amazing
                        solutions.</p</div>
